## Aim of experiment

- The fed-batch strategy is typically used in bio-industrial processes to reach a high cell density in the bioreactor. Mostly the feed solution is highly concentrated to avoid dilution of the bioreactor. Production of heterologous proteins by fed-batch cultures of recombinant microorganisms have been extensively studied.
- Fed-batch fermentation is operated specifically to remove material and toxic inhibitors found in normal batch fermentation systems at high substrate concentration. Upscale fed-batch fermentation was investigated to decrease toxic compounds and increase butanol formation, simultaneously. This experiment illustrated the process flows.
