## Aim of the Experiment

Fed-batch fermentation is operated specifically to remove material and toxic inhibitors found in normal batch fermentation systems at high substrate concentration. Upscale fed-batch fermentation was investigated to decrease toxic compounds and increase butanol formation, simultaneously.
